# University Notes
Ash's course notes. Taken as part of MSci Physics with Particle Physics and Cosmology at the University of Birmingham, UK. Covers the following modules:
- LC Classical Mechanics and Relativity 1
- LC Mathematics for Physicists 1A
- LC Introduction to Probability and Statistics
- LC Quantum Mechanics and Optics and Waves.

The setup is heavily derived from Gilles Castel's work, and has been tweaked to my uses.
