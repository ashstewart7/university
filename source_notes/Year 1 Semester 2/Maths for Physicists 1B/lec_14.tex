Recap of last lecture:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Soluble by direct integration:
    \[
        \frac{dy}{dx} = f(x) \implies y(x) = \int f(x) dx + c
    \]

    \item Separable equations:
    \[
        \frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{f(x)}{g(y)} \implies \int f(x) dx = \int g(y) dy
    \]

    \item Exact equations:
    
    Given in the form (or re-arrangeable to the form):
    \[
        M(x, y) dx + N(x, y) dy = 0
    \]

    These are soluble if:
    \[
        M(x, y) = \frac{df}{dx} \qquad N(x, y) = \frac{df}{dy}
    \]
    With $f(x, y) = c$.

    The condition for an equation being exact is:
    \[
        \frac{\partial M}{\partial y} = \frac{\partial N}{\partial x}
    \]
\end{itemize}

\section{``Homogeneous'' Equations}
Here, the word homogenous has a different meaning to classification of differentiating equations. If we have some function that satisfied this:
\[
    g(\lambda x, \lambda y) = \lambda^p g(x, y)
\]

We call it a homogeneous function of order $p$. 

``Homogeneous'' differential equations in this case are functions of the form:
\[
    \frac{dy}{dx} = f \left(\frac{y}{x}\right)    
\]

Here, we make the substitution $v(x) = y(x)/x$. We can write:
\[
    y(x) = v(x) x
\]

And substitute back in. We use the product rule where:
\[
    \frac{dy}{dx} = x \frac{dv}{dx} + v = f(v)
\]
\[
    x \frac{dv}{dx} = f(v) - v
\]

This is now separable, so:
\[
    \int \frac{dv}{f(v) - v} = \int \frac{dx}{x}
\]

\subsection{Example}
\[
    2xy dy - (x^2 + y^2) dx = 0
\]
This is not exact, so we put it into a standard form and substitute:
\[
    2xy dy = (x^2 + y^2) dx
\]
\[
    \frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{x^2 + y^2}{2xy} = \frac{(y/x)^2 + 1}{2 (y/x)}
\]

Let $u(x) = y/x$:
