\section*{Doppler Effect of Photons / EM Waves}
Rather than considering sound waves, we consider the doppler effect for photons travelling at the speed of light.

\[
    f_\text{emission} \neq f_\text{observer}, \quad \text{if observer is moving relative to the source.}
\]

In this context, frequency is often denoted $\nu$ not $f$. $\lambda$ keeps its original meaning of wavelength.
