\textbf{Office Hours:} Thursday 11am - 1pm, Physics West Rm 222 (b.becsy@bham.ac.uk)

Previous, when looking at two or more variables for error propogation/combinations etc, we assumed that they were independant of one another. Today we look at how to handle multiple variables which may be correlated.

\section*{Covariance}
Covariance is a measure that indicates how much two variables fluctuate together:
\[
\text{Cov}(x,y) = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} (x_i - \bar{x})(y_i - \bar{y})
\]

Covariance matrices represent all combinations of covariance (noting Cov(x, y) = Cov(y, x) and Cov(x, y) = Var(x))

$$\Sigma = \begin{pmatrix}
    Cov(x, x) & Cov(x, y) \\
    Cov(y, x) & Cov(y, y)
\end{pmatrix}$$

We can then define correlation:
\[
    Corr(x, y) = \frac{Cov(x, y)}{\sqrt{Var(x)Var(y)}} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{N} (x_i - \bar{x})(y_i-\bar{y})}{\sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{N} (x_i - \bar{x})^2 \sum_{i=1}^{N} (y_i - \bar{y})^2}}
\]
This is bounded between -1 (x = -y), y (x = y) and zero for no correlation. We can again put this in a matrix, noting it is symmetrical:
\[
    \begin{pmatrix}
    1 & Corr(x, y) \\
    Corr(y, x) & 1
    \end{pmatrix}
\]

\subsection*{Variable Combinations}
Now, with correlated variables, we can say:
\[
    \langle x + y\rangle = \langle x\rangle + \langle y\rangle
\]

\[
    Var(x, y) = Var(x) + Var(y) + 2Cov(x, y)
\]

And (noting the mean slightly increases with correlated variables):
\[
    \langle xy\rangle = \langle x\rangle \langle y\rangle + Cov(x, y)
\]
And the one formula to rule them all
\[
    Var(f) \approx \frac{\partial f}{\partial A}^2 Var(A) + \frac{\partial f}{\partial B}^2 Var(B) + 2 \frac{\partial f}{\partial A} \frac{\partial f}{\partial B} Cov(A, B)
\]
